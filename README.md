In this paper we present about continuous calibration for a set of data from Robert Koch institute about the spread of contagion Covid-19 which is then run on the agent-based model created in netlogo that simulates the spread of the contagion. The model shows typical scenarios like spread of contagion before the lockdowns and after the lockdowns, in which we show calibration and its consistency with the data and how close the model is to replicate situations represented in real world. The model here is treated as a black box from which we get a set of parameters after calibration is done and new pa-rameters for data that is being generated during lockdowns, there by generat-ing new parameters for each calibration being done there by leading to con-tinuous calibration, which also addresses when the calibration and recalibra-tion with new parameters will be required.
